# Environmental Monitoring: A Comparative Analysis of Noise Pollution

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze and predict noise pollution levels across major Indian cities using data from 2019 and 2020. The analysis involves preprocessing the raw data and then training a machine learning model to predict future noise levels based on historical data and location-specific features.

The project is divided into two main parts:
1.  **Week 1:** Data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering.
2.  **Week 2:** Training a predictive model and evaluating its performance.

## Dataset

The dataset used is `RS_Session_255_AU_1338_3.csv`, which contains noise level readings from various monitoring stations across different Indian cities for the years 2019 and 2020. It includes details such as location type (Commercial, Residential, etc.), permissible noise limits, and the recorded average noise levels (Leq) in dB(A).
